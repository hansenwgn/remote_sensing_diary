    "text": "1.1 Summary\nTo summarise, I’d want to convey what I learned in this chapter’s introduction to remote sensing. I’ll go through some of the key concepts, objectives, and lessons learned from the sentinel and landsat data practicals.\n\n1.1.1 Objective\nTo be able to operationalise remotely sensed Earth observation data for informing decisions on environmental hazards arising from a changing climate, specifically in relation to (a) urban areas and (b) future urban sustainability.\n\n\n1.1.2 Key Concepts\n\n1.1.2.1 Remote Sensing\nRefers to obtaining information about objects or areas at the Earth’s surface without being in direct contact with the object or area. Acquiring information from the distance.\nTwo types of sensors:\n\nPassive. Use energy that is available, usually detecting reflected energy from the sun. Energy is in electromagnetic. Such as: human eye, camera, satellite sensor.\nActive. Actively emits electromagnetic waves and then waits to receive. Have an energy source for illumination. Such as: radar, x-ray, LiDAR.\n\n\n\n1.1.2.2 Electromagnetic Waves\nElectromagnetic radiation (has both electric and magnetic fields) propagates (moves) as waves.\nElectromagnetic waves interact with:\n\nEarth’s surface\n\n\nEnergy being absorbed by the surface\nEnergy being transmitted through the surface\n\n\nAtmosphere\n\nEnergy can be scattered by particles in the atmosphere. Three types of atmospheric scattering:\n\nRayleigh = particles are very small compared to the wavelength\nMie = particles are the same size compared to the wavelength\nNon selective = particles are much larger than the wavelength\n\n\n\n\n\nElectromagnetic waves\n\n\n\nWe can apply this principle to examples from our own lives, such as reflections on why the sky is blue. Why is the sky above the moon black? An ever-evolving sensor capable of piercing weather/cloud barriers to land capture.\n\n\n1.1.2.3 Four resolutions of remotely sensed data\n\nSpatial = the size of the raster grid per pixel (e.g. 20cm or 30m)\nSpectral = the number of bands it records data in\nTemporal = the time it revisits (e.g. daily, every 7 days, on demand)\nRadiometric = identify differences in light or reflectance, in practice this is the range of possible values.\n\n\n\n\n1.1.3 Sentinel Data (practical with QGIS and SNAP)\nI download the sentinel data from Copernicus Open Access Hub and get Jakarta, Indonesia area. Sentinel offers a variety of products. We must understand that each may have distinct bands, resolutions, and core wavelengths.\nThe image below is a true colour composite using a multi band colour render type and merging all bands in QGIS. Along with a graph representation of the spectral signature.\n\n\n\n\nJakarta sentinel data in QGIS\n\n\n\nImage below shows the resampling masking of Jakarta sentinel data used SNAP application. We can do a variety of things with Sentinel’s remote sensing data using SNAP. We can manipulate colours, perform statistical analysis and plotting, and transform tasselled caps. We can calculate the brightness, greeness, and wetness of an image to assist us recognise and identify soil, green plants, and moisture.\n\n\n\n\nJakarta sentinel data in SNAP"

    "text": "1.2 Applications\nI examine how sentinel data has been used and applied in the ‘Sentinel-2 Data for Land Cover/Use Mapping: A Review’ literature (Phiri et al., 2020). Human activities and natural disasters such as urbanisation, agriculture development, flooding, and fire are rapidly modifying the land cover. Learning this concept helped me realise how critical it is to monitor all of these factors for the long-term viability of human existence. The advancement of satellite remote sensing technologies has transformed methods of monitoring natural and human resources on the Earth’s surface. Sentinel-2 satellites are the second constellation of ESA Sentinel missions and are equipped with multispectral sensors. The Sentinel-2 mission’s primary goal is to provide high resolution satellite data for land cover/use monitoring, climate change monitoring, and disaster monitoring, as well as to supplement other satellite missions such as Landsat.\nThis journal is particularly intriguing since it examines the contribution of ESA Sentinel-2 data to land cover/use classification and the performance of Sentinel-2 data in various applications (e.g., forest, urban area and natural hazard monitoring). The current research demonstrates that Sentinel-2 has a favourable influence on land cover/use monitoring, notably crop, forest, urban area, and water resource monitoring. The open access policy encourages the increased use of Sentinel-2 data, particularly in developing nations with limited financial means for the collecting of remotely sensed data.\nPorphyry copper deposits (PCDs) supply three-quarters of the world’s Cu (Copper) (Sillitoe, 2010) and are characterized by hydrothermal alteration and mineralization zones. Remote sensing has been used for hydrothermally altered minerals mapping and mineral prospecting. Sentinel-2A can extract hydroxyl-bearing minerals and iron oxides (Hu et al., 2018). The combinations of bands of the Sentinel may detect specific zones that associated with mineralization prospects. The utilisation of this remote sensing data is highly valuable in assessing the potential of the mineralization zone before undertaking operational or costly production measures."

    "text": "1.3 Reflection\nFrom this new concept that I learned, I’m thinking to apply the sentinel data analysis to monitor the Kalimantan Island in Indonesia. Indonesia is in the process of moving the capital city from Jakarta (Java Island) to Kalimantan Island (website). One of the main principles of the new capital city (IKN) project is designed according to nature. Over 75% of the IKN’s Governmental Zone will remain green (“IKN - ibu kota negara,” 2021). We can utilise remote sensing data to monitor land cover/use, notably crop, forest, urban area, and water resource monitoring. Monitoring city development is difficult, so if it can be aided, particularly in an automated scheme, through the use of remote sensing data, it will substantially simplify the government’s task."

This is typically done by aligning the individual images and blending them together to create a seamless result.\nMosaicking remote sensing data:\n\nPreprocessing: Before the mosaicking process can begin, the individual images need to be preprocessed to ensure that they are properly aligned and have the same radiometric properties (brightness and contrast). This may involve correcting for differences in atmospheric conditions, sensor characteristics, and other factors that can affect the quality of the image.\nGeoreferencing: To ensure that the individual images align properly, they need to be georeferenced, or assigned a specific location on the Earth’s surface. This involves identifying specific features in the images that can be matched to known locations on a map or in a geographic information system (GIS).\nBlending: Once the individual images are properly aligned and georeferenced, they need to be blended together to create a seamless result. This may involve adjusting the brightness and contrast of the images, as well as using techniques such as feathering and smoothing to create a smooth transition between adjacent images.\nOutput: The final output of the mosaicking process can take many forms, depending on the intended application. This may include a single image that covers a large area, a series of smaller images that can be tiled together, or a mosaic that combines multiple images into a single seamless result.\n\n\n\n\n\nProcessing and Dynamic Raster Mosaicking\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImage enhancement techniques are used to improve the visual quality of remote sensing data, to increase the accuracy of image interpretation, and to prepare data for analysis. Some commonly used techniques:\n\nRatio: Ratio image enhancement is used to highlight certain features in remote sensing data. It involves dividing two bands of a multi-spectral image to create a new image, where each pixel represents the ratio of the two bands. Ratio enhancement can be used to identify features such as vegetation, soil moisture, and water quality.\nFiltering: Filtering is used to remove noise from remote sensing data and to enhance certain features. There are many different types of filters that can be used, including mean, median, and Gaussian filters. Each filter has different strengths and weaknesses, and the choice of filter will depend on the specific application.\nPrincipal Component Analysis (PCA): PCA is a technique used to reduce the dimensionality of multi-spectral images. It involves transforming the data into a new set of variables that represent the most important features of the image. PCA can be used to enhance certain features, reduce noise, and compress the data.\nTexture: Texture analysis is used to identify patterns in remote sensing data. It involves analyzing the spatial arrangement of pixels in an image to identify areas with similar texture. Texture analysis can be used to identify features such as forests, urban areas, and water bodies.\nFusion: Image fusion is used to combine information from multiple sources to create a single image with enhanced information content. This can include combining multi-spectral and panchromatic data, or combining data from different sensors. Image fusion can be used to enhance the visual quality of an image and to improve the accuracy of image interpretation."

The authors propose a simple methodology for monitoring and assessing temporal variations of water quality using an earth observation-based approach. The proposed method involves selecting a sampling area on the image, applying masking and convolution image processing filters, and using the darkest pixel atmospheric correction. The authors applied the method to a series of eight archived Landsat-5 TM images of the Lower Thames Valley area in West London and the Kourris Dam in Cyprus. They found that atmospheric correction is essential for water quality assessment studies using satellite remote sensing data as it significantly improves the water reflectance and enables effective water quality assessment to be made.\n\nRadiometric Calibration for Multispectral Camera of Different Imaging Conditions Mounted on a UAV Platform (Guo et al. 2019)\n\n\nThis paper discusses the importance of radiometric calibration in using unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) multispectral images for quantitative remote sensing (QRS) in ecological and agricultural applications. The authors propose a systematic radiometric calibration method using linear regression to generate multispectral images with unit reflectance, which can then be used to calculate vegetation indices for monitoring vegetation phenology. The study evaluates the effects of different flight altitudes, time instants, and weather conditions on radiometric calibration using a Mini Multiple Camera Array (MCA) 6 camera. The authors find that three calibration targets (dark, moderate, and white) are optimal for the Mini MCA 6 camera and that atmospheric effects increase with flight altitude but the camera effect and atmospheric attenuation to reflectance are relatively low. The study shows that the linear regression method performs well in all weather conditions and proposes a universal calibration equation suitable for images acquired during a sunny day or even with some clouds. Overall, the paper demonstrates the importance of radiometric calibration in using UAV multispectral images for QRS and provides a systematic method for calibration."

This allows researchers to detect changes and trends over time and space.\nEnhances interpretation: Corrected remote sensing data provides a more accurate representation of the Earth’s surface, which enhances the interpretation of features and phenomena. This, in turn, can lead to better decision-making in various fields, including agriculture, forestry, urban planning, and environmental management.\nIncreases efficiency: Corrected remote sensing data can save time and resources by reducing the need for ground-based measurements and increasing the speed and accuracy of data analysis.\nProvides new insights: Corrected remote sensing data can reveal information that is not visible to the naked eye or easily detectable with ground-based measurements. This can lead to new insights and discoveries in various fields of research.\n\nIn summary, learning correction in remote sensing data and its applications is crucial for improving the accuracy, efficiency, and interpretation of remote sensing data, as well as for making new discoveries and driving progress in various fields of research and practice.\n\n\n\n\nGuo, Yahui, J.
