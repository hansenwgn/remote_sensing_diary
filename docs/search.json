    "text": "1.1 Summary\nTo summarise, I’d want to convey what I learned in this chapter’s introduction to remote sensing. I’ll go through some of the key concepts, objectives, and lessons learned from the sentinel and landsat data practicals.\n\n1.1.1 Objective\nTo be able to operationalise remotely sensed Earth observation data for informing decisions on environmental hazards arising from a changing climate, specifically in relation to (a) urban areas and (b) future urban sustainability.\n\n\n1.1.2 Key Concepts\n\n1.1.2.1 Remote Sensing\nRefers to obtaining information about objects or areas at the Earth’s surface without being in direct contact with the object or area. Acquiring information from the distance.\nTwo types of sensors:\n\nPassive. Use energy that is available, usually detecting reflected energy from the sun. Energy is in electromagnetic. Such as: human eye, camera, satellite sensor.\nActive. Actively emits electromagnetic waves and then waits to receive. Have an energy source for illumination. Such as: radar, x-ray, LiDAR.\n\n\n\n1.1.2.2 Electromagnetic Waves\nElectromagnetic radiation (has both electric and magnetic fields) propagates (moves) as waves.\nElectromagnetic waves interact with:\n\nEarth’s surface\n\n\nEnergy being absorbed by the surface\nEnergy being transmitted through the surface\n\n\nAtmosphere\n\nEnergy can be scattered by particles in the atmosphere. Three types of atmospheric scattering:\n\nRayleigh = particles are very small compared to the wavelength\nMie = particles are the same size compared to the wavelength\nNon selective = particles are much larger than the wavelength\n\n\n\n\n\nElectromagnetic waves\n\n\n\nWe can apply this principle to examples from our own lives, such as reflections on why the sky is blue. Why is the sky above the moon black? An ever-evolving sensor capable of piercing weather/cloud barriers to land capture.\n\n\n1.1.2.3 Four resolutions of remotely sensed data\n\nSpatial = the size of the raster grid per pixel (e.g. 20cm or 30m)\nSpectral = the number of bands it records data in\nTemporal = the time it revisits (e.g. daily, every 7 days, on demand)\nRadiometric = identify differences in light or reflectance, in practice this is the range of possible values.\n\n\n\n\n1.1.3 Sentinel Data (practical with QGIS and SNAP)\nI download the sentinel data from Copernicus Open Access Hub and get Jakarta, Indonesia area. Sentinel offers a variety of products. We must understand that each may have distinct bands, resolutions, and core wavelengths.\nThe image below is a true colour composite using a multi band colour render type and merging all bands in QGIS. Along with a graph representation of the spectral signature.\n\n\n\n\nJakarta sentinel data in QGIS\n\n\n\nImage below shows the resampling masking of Jakarta sentinel data used SNAP application. We can do a variety of things with Sentinel’s remote sensing data using SNAP. We can manipulate colours, perform statistical analysis and plotting, and transform tasselled caps. We can calculate the brightness, greeness, and wetness of an image to assist us recognise and identify soil, green plants, and moisture.\n\n\n\n\nJakarta sentinel data in SNAP"

    "text": "1.2 Applications\nI examine how sentinel data has been used and applied in the ‘Sentinel-2 Data for Land Cover/Use Mapping: A Review’ literature (Phiri et al. 2020). Human activities and natural disasters such as urbanisation, agriculture development, flooding, and fire are rapidly modifying the land cover. Learning this concept helped me realise how critical it is to monitor all of these factors for the long-term viability of human existence. The advancement of satellite remote sensing technologies has transformed methods of monitoring natural and human resources on the Earth’s surface. Sentinel-2 satellites are the second constellation of ESA Sentinel missions and are equipped with multispectral sensors. The Sentinel-2 mission’s primary goal is to provide high resolution satellite data for land cover/use monitoring, climate change monitoring, and disaster monitoring, as well as to supplement other satellite missions such as Landsat.\nThis journal is particularly intriguing since it examines the contribution of ESA Sentinel-2 data to land cover/use classification and the performance of Sentinel-2 data in various applications (e.g., forest, urban area and natural hazard monitoring). The current research demonstrates that Sentinel-2 has a favourable influence on land cover/use monitoring, notably crop, forest, urban area, and water resource monitoring. The open access policy encourages the increased use of Sentinel-2 data, particularly in developing nations with limited financial means for the collecting of remotely sensed data.\nPorphyry copper deposits (PCDs) supply three-quarters of the world’s Cu (Copper) (Sillitoe 2010) and are characterized by hydrothermal alteration and mineralization zones. Remote sensing has been used for hydrothermally altered minerals mapping and mineral prospecting. Sentinel-2A can extract hydroxyl-bearing minerals and iron oxides (Hu et al. 2018). The combinations of bands of the Sentinel may detect specific zones that associated with mineralization prospects. The utilisation of this remote sensing data is highly valuable in assessing the potential of the mineralization zone before undertaking operational or costly production measures."

    "text": "1.3 Reflection\nFrom this new concept that I learned, I’m thinking to apply the sentinel data analysis to monitor the Kalimantan Island in Indonesia. Indonesia is in the process of moving the capital city from Jakarta (Java Island) to Kalimantan Island (website). One of the main principles of the new capital city (IKN) project is designed according to nature. Over 75% of the IKN’s Governmental Zone will remain green (“IKN - Ibu Kota Negara” 2021). We can utilise remote sensing data to monitor land cover/use, notably crop, forest, urban area, and water resource monitoring. Monitoring city development is difficult, so if it can be aided, particularly in an automated scheme, through the use of remote sensing data, it will substantially simplify the government’s task.\n\n\n\n\nHu, Bin, Yongyang Xu, Bo Wan, Xincai Wu, and Guihua Yi. 2018. “Hydrothermally Altered Mineral Mapping Using Synthetic Application of Sentinel-2A MSI, ASTER and Hyperion Data in the Duolong Area, Tibetan Plateau, China.” Ore Geology Reviews 101: 384–97. https://doi.org/https://doi.org/10.1016/j.oregeorev.2018.07.017.\n\n\n“IKN - Ibu Kota Negara.” 2021. https://ikn.go.id/.\n\n\nPhiri, Darius, Matamyo Simwanda, Serajis Salekin, Vincent R.

This is typically done by aligning the individual images and blending them together to create a seamless result.\nMosaicking remote sensing data:\n\nPreprocessing: Before the mosaicking process can begin, the individual images need to be preprocessed to ensure that they are properly aligned and have the same radiometric properties (brightness and contrast). This may involve correcting for differences in atmospheric conditions, sensor characteristics, and other factors that can affect the quality of the image.\nGeoreferencing: To ensure that the individual images align properly, they need to be georeferenced, or assigned a specific location on the Earth’s surface. This involves identifying specific features in the images that can be matched to known locations on a map or in a geographic information system (GIS).\nBlending: Once the individual images are properly aligned and georeferenced, they need to be blended together to create a seamless result. This may involve adjusting the brightness and contrast of the images, as well as using techniques such as feathering and smoothing to create a smooth transition between adjacent images.\nOutput: The final output of the mosaicking process can take many forms, depending on the intended application. This may include a single image that covers a large area, a series of smaller images that can be tiled together, or a mosaic that combines multiple images into a single seamless result.\n\n\n\n\n\nProcessing and Dynamic Raster Mosaicking\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImage enhancement techniques are used to improve the visual quality of remote sensing data, to increase the accuracy of image interpretation, and to prepare data for analysis. Some commonly used techniques:\n\nRatio: Ratio image enhancement is used to highlight certain features in remote sensing data. It involves dividing two bands of a multi-spectral image to create a new image, where each pixel represents the ratio of the two bands. Ratio enhancement can be used to identify features such as vegetation, soil moisture, and water quality.\nFiltering: Filtering is used to remove noise from remote sensing data and to enhance certain features. There are many different types of filters that can be used, including mean, median, and Gaussian filters. Each filter has different strengths and weaknesses, and the choice of filter will depend on the specific application.\nPrincipal Component Analysis (PCA): PCA is a technique used to reduce the dimensionality of multi-spectral images. It involves transforming the data into a new set of variables that represent the most important features of the image. PCA can be used to enhance certain features, reduce noise, and compress the data.\nTexture: Texture analysis is used to identify patterns in remote sensing data. It involves analyzing the spatial arrangement of pixels in an image to identify areas with similar texture. Texture analysis can be used to identify features such as forests, urban areas, and water bodies.\nFusion: Image fusion is used to combine information from multiple sources to create a single image with enhanced information content. This can include combining multi-spectral and panchromatic data, or combining data from different sensors. Image fusion can be used to enhance the visual quality of an image and to improve the accuracy of image interpretation."

    "text": "3.2 Applications\n\nAssessment of temporal variations of water quality in inland water bodies using atmospheric corrected satellite remotely sensed image data (Hadjimitsis and Clayton 2009)\n\nThis paper discusses the problem of atmospheric intervention in satellite remote sensing data when monitoring water quality in inland water bodies such as reservoirs, lakes, and dams. The authors propose a simple methodology for monitoring and assessing temporal variations of water quality using an earth observation-based approach. The proposed method involves selecting a sampling area on the image, applying masking and convolution image processing filters, and using the darkest pixel atmospheric correction. The authors applied the method to a series of eight archived Landsat-5 TM images of the Lower Thames Valley area in West London and the Kourris Dam in Cyprus. They found that atmospheric correction is essential for water quality assessment studies using satellite remote sensing data as it significantly improves the water reflectance and enables effective water quality assessment to be made.\n\nRadiometric Calibration for Multispectral Camera of Different Imaging Conditions Mounted on a UAV Platform (Guo et al. 2019)\n\n\nThis paper discusses the importance of radiometric calibration in using unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) multispectral images for quantitative remote sensing (QRS) in ecological and agricultural applications. The authors propose a systematic radiometric calibration method using linear regression to generate multispectral images with unit reflectance, which can then be used to calculate vegetation indices for monitoring vegetation phenology. The study evaluates the effects of different flight altitudes, time instants, and weather conditions on radiometric calibration using a Mini Multiple Camera Array (MCA) 6 camera. The authors find that three calibration targets (dark, moderate, and white) are optimal for the Mini MCA 6 camera and that atmospheric effects increase with flight altitude but the camera effect and atmospheric attenuation to reflectance are relatively low. The study shows that the linear regression method performs well in all weather conditions and proposes a universal calibration equation suitable for images acquired during a sunny day or even with some clouds. Overall, the paper demonstrates the importance of radiometric calibration in using UAV multispectral images for QRS and provides a systematic method for calibration."

To achieve greener city both in Jakarta and Kalimantan we can monitor air quality.\nStudy case from Morocco in using satellites data in monitoring air pollution. In this study, they used the EUMETCast service to create a remote sensing system based on data from polar satellites (MetOp) and geostationary satellites (Meteosat). A Java-based application was used to collect and process data. Using Python libraries, an interactive map of Morocco was designed and developed, displaying real-time values of environmental and pollution datasets. The application implemented displays various industrial activity locations as well as related densities of emitted gases. The application could collect and process data in real and near-real time, as well as display results in figures and specific charts. The emissions from these areas, as depicted on the map, may have an impact on neighbouring zones, which include cities and villages. These findings could help policymakers find appropriate solutions to potential pollution-related problems (Boudriki Semlali, El Amrani, and Denys 2019).\n\n\n\n\nCO densities of 2017/04/27 at 20h in Morocco\n\n\n\nSAT-CEP-monitor uses complex event processing and satellite remote sensing to monitor air quality. CEP technology integrates batch and streaming processing to enable NRT satellite sensor data processing. Thus, we can obtain satellite data from areas of interest and provide valuable and user-friendly information on important pollutants. Even without MGS, we can obtain and visualise air quality data from anywhere on Earth in under 40 minutes (“SAT-CEP-Monitor: An Air Quality Monitoring Software Architecture Combining Complex Event Processing with Satellite Remote Sensing” 2021).\nAfter downloading satellite sensor data, the proposed solution calculates over 150 000 input rows in 17 seconds using 4 Gb of RAM and 5 Mb of storage space. Thus, this software is novel in helping solve RSBD streaming processing problems.\n\n\n\n\nSAT-CEP-Monitor architecture"

It includes a comprehensive set of tools and capabilities for working with remote sensing and other geospatial data, such as visualisation, analysis, and data manipulation.\n\n\n\n\nEarth Engine Data Catalog: GEE provides access to a vast amount of geospatial data from various sources, such as satellite imagery, climate data, and terrain data. The Earth Engine Data Catalog is a centralised repository where users can browse and access these datasets.\nEarth Engine Code Editor: GEE’s Code Editor is a web-based development environment that allows users to write and run JavaScript or Python scripts to analyse geospatial data. The Code Editor includes a number of tools and functions that make working with geospatial data easier, such as map visualisation and image processing.\nEarth Engine API: Earth Engine API (Application Programming Interface): The Earth Engine API (Application Programming Interface) is a collection of functions and classes that allow developers to interact with GEE programmatically. It enables the incorporation of GEE’s geospatial data processing and analysis capabilities into customised applications and workflows.\nEarth Engine JavaScript and Python APIs: The Earth Engine APIs in JavaScript and Python: GEE provides APIs in both JavaScript and Python, allowing users to select the language that best suits their needs for data processing and analysis.\nEarth Engine Fusion Tables: Earth Engine Fusion Tables: Using Google Fusion Tables, GEE users can upload and share data tables. Users can use this feature to create and share custom data layers to supplement their geospatial analyses.\n\n\n\n\n\nLoading image collections: Image collections are groups of images in GEE that share common properties such as spatial resolution, data type, and date range. The ‘ee.ImageCollection’ function loads image collections and allows users to filter them by date range, location, or other properties.\nReducing images: GEE includes image reduction functions such as ‘reduceRegion’, ‘reduceRegionToImage’, and ‘reduceRegions’. Users can use these functions to aggregate pixel values within regions of interest, such as administrative boundaries or study areas, to generate summary statistics such as mean, median, and standard deviation.\nRegression: Regression analysis is carried out in GEE using the ‘ee.Reducer.linearRegression’ function, which computes the coefficients of a linear regression model for a given set of predictors and response variables. This function can be used to identify relationships between different geospatial datasets, such as temperature and vegetation cover.\nJoins: The ‘ee.Join’ function in GEE allows users to join two image collections or tables based on a common property such as a unique ID or a spatial relationship. This function is useful for combining datasets from various sources, such as satellite imagery and ground-based observations.\nFiltering: The ‘ee.Filter’ and ‘ee.Filter.inList’ functions in GEE allow you to filter image or feature collections based on specific criteria. These functions can be used to remove cloud cover and other undesirable features from satellite imagery, as well as to select specific features within a given area of interest."

Remote sensing and machine learning classification algorithms have enabled cost-effective, accurate irrigated area delineation. The best image classification algorithm depends on the goals, but the random forest machine learning algorithm used in this study is scalable and cost-effective. Google Earth Engine’s big-data platform improved this (GEE). A two-year analysis (2019 and 2020) of 10-day Sentinel and 16-day Landsat data produced the 20-m-resolution cultivated land dataset. The GEE cloud-computing platform managed and processed large volumes of remotely sensed products and reference training and validation datasets from various sources for the random forest algorithm. GEE’s methods helped classify petabyte-volume big data into more accurate irrigated areas quickly. The developed, cultivated areas dataset is 88% accurate. Policymakers need improved irrigated area mapping outputs to evaluate large and complex irrigation systems. They are essential for field-to-national irrigation monitoring (Magidi et al. 2021).\n\n\n\n\nNDVI time-series data derived from Landsat images, compiled using Google Earth Engine, were then used to classify and distinguish irrigated from rainfed areas"

    "text": "6.1 Summary\n\n\n\nClassification and Regression Trees (CART) are a type of decision tree algorithm used for both classification and regression problems. In CART, the data is split into smaller and smaller subsets based on the values of predictor variables in a way that maximizes the homogeneity of the response variable within each subset. The algorithm recursively applies this splitting process until a stopping criterion is met.\nOne measure used to evaluate the performance of CART models is the Sum of Squared Residuals (SSR), which is the sum of the squared differences between the predicted and actual values of the response variable. The goal is to minimize the SSR in order to obtain a model that best fits the data.\n\n\n\n\nSubset the data when linear regression doesn’t fit\n\n\n\nOverfitting is a common problem in machine learning where a model is too complex and fits the training data too closely, resulting in poor performance on new, unseen data. This can occur when the model is trained with too much complexity or when it is trained on a dataset that is too small or unrepresentative.\n\n\n\nRandom forests are a type of machine learning algorithm used for classification and regression tasks. A random forest’s basic idea is to train multiple decision trees, each on a different subset of available data and a random subset of available features. When making a prediction, each tree in the forest makes its own prediction, and the final prediction is determined by a majority vote of all of the trees’ predictions.\n\n\n\n\nThe random forest algorithm relies on multiple decision trees that are all trained slightly differently; all of them are taken into consideration for the final classification\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImage classification is the process of labelling or categorising an image. The algorithm is trained on a set of labelled images in supervised image classification, which means that each image is associated with a specific category or label. The algorithm learns to recognise patterns or features in the images associated with each label, and then uses those patterns to make predictions on new, unlabeled images. Unsupervised image classification, on the other hand, entails grouping similar images together based on patterns or features identified by the algorithm.\nTo apply these concepts to imagery, we can perform image classification tasks using machine learning algorithms such as random forests. For example, we could train a random forest algorithm to recognise specific objects or features in labelled images, such as trees or roads. The algorithm can then predict the presence or absence of those objects or features in images when presented with new, unlabeled images. This image classification technique has a wide range of practical applications, including remote sensing and satellite imagery analysis, as well as computer vision and autonomous vehicles."

In terms of classification accuracy, this study compares multiclass SVMs to maximum likelihood (ML) and artificial neural network (ANN) methods in two experiments. The two land cover classification experiments employ multispectral (Landsat7 ETM+) and hyperspectral (DAIS) data for test areas in eastern England and central Spain, respectively. The results show that the SVM classifier outperforms the ML and ANN classifiers in terms of classification accuracy, and that it can be used with small training datasets as well as highdimensional data.\n\n\n\n\nVariation in classification accuracy with increasing number of features and fixed training dataset."

It can be used in medicine to identify tumours or other medical conditions in medical images such as CT scans or MRI scans.\nRandom forest is a machine learning algorithm that can be used for classification as well as regression. It is widely used in a variety of industries, including finance, healthcare, and marketing. In finance, for example, it can be used to forecast stock prices or assess credit risk. It can be used in healthcare to predict patient outcomes or to identify risk factors for certain diseases. It can be used in marketing to segment customers and predict their behaviour.\nI personally participated in a hackathon and used the concept of image recognition and classification in healthcare that can be implemented in Indonesia.\nMachine learning and classification algorithms, in my opinion, are important because they enable us to automate decision-making processes and make predictions based on large amounts of data. This can lead to more accurate and efficient decision-making, which can be useful in a variety of situations. It is important to note, however, that machine learning algorithms are not perfect and can be biassed or produce inaccurate results if they are not properly trained or validated.\n\n\n\n\nPal, M., and P.
