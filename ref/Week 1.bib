	abstract = {Remote sensing is a technique to observe the earth surface or the atmosphere from out of space using satellites (space borne) or from the air using aircrafts (airborne). Remote sensing uses a part or several parts of the electromagnetic spectrum. It records the electromagnetic energy reflected or emitted by the earth’s surface. The amount of radiation from an object (called radiance) is influenced by both the properties of the object and the radiation hitting the object (irradiance). The human eyes register the solar light reflected by these objects and our brains interpret the colours, the grey tones and intensity variations. In remote sensing various kinds of tools and devices are used to make electromagnetic radiation outside this range from 400 to 700 nm visible to the human eye, especially the near infrared, middle-infrared, thermal-infrared and microwaves.},

	abstract = {The advancement in satellite remote sensing technology has revolutionised the approaches to monitoring the Earth’s surface. The development of the Copernicus Programme by the European Space Agency (ESA) and the European Union (EU) has contributed to the effective monitoring of the Earth’s surface by producing the Sentinel-2 multispectral products. Sentinel-2 satellites are the second constellation of the ESA Sentinel missions and carry onboard multispectral scanners. The primary objective of the Sentinel-2 mission is to provide high resolution satellite data for land cover/use monitoring, climate change and disaster monitoring, as well as complementing the other satellite missions such as Landsat. Since the launch of Sentinel-2 multispectral instruments in 2015, there have been many studies on land cover/use classification which use Sentinel-2 images. However, no review studies have been dedicated to the application of ESA Sentinel-2 land cover/use monitoring. Therefore, this review focuses on two aspects: (1) assessing the contribution of ESA Sentinel-2 to land cover/use classification, and (2) exploring the performance of Sentinel-2 data in different applications (e.g., forest, urban area and natural hazard monitoring). The present review shows that Sentinel-2 has a positive impact on land cover/use monitoring, specifically in monitoring of crop, forests, urban areas, and water resources. The contemporary high adoption and application of Sentinel-2 can be attributed to the higher spatial resolution (10 m) than other medium spatial resolution images, the high temporal resolution of 5 days and the availability of the red-edge bands with multiple applications. The ability to integrate Sentinel-2 data with other remotely sensed data, as part of data analysis, improves the overall accuracy (OA) when working with Sentinel-2 images. The free access policy drives the increasing use of Sentinel-2 data, especially in developing countries where financial resources for the acquisition of remotely sensed data are limited. The literature also shows that the use of Sentinel-2 data produces high accuracies (\&gt;80\%) with machine-learning classifiers such as support vector machine (SVM) and Random forest (RF). However, other classifiers such as maximum likelihood analysis are also common. Although Sentinel-2 offers many opportunities for land cover/use classification, there are challenges which include mismatching with Landsat OLI-8 data, a lack of thermal bands, and the differences in spatial resolution among the bands of Sentinel-2. Sentinel-2 data show promise and have the potential to contribute significantly towards land cover/use monitoring.},

	abstract = {Porphyry Cu systems host some of the most widely distributed mineralization types at convergent plate boundaries, including porphyry deposits centered on intrusions; skarn, carbonate-replacement, and sediment-hosted Au deposits in increasingly peripheral locations; and superjacent high- and intermediate-sulfidation epithermal deposits. The systems commonly define linear belts, some many hundreds of kilometers long, as well as occurring less commonly in apparent isolation. The systems are closely related to underlying composite plutons, at paleodepths of 5 to 15 km, which represent the supply chambers for the magmas and fluids that formed the vertically elongate (\&gt;3 km) stocks or dike swarms and associated mineralization. The plutons may erupt volcanic rocks, but generally prior to initiation of the systems. Commonly, several discrete stocks are emplaced in and above the pluton roof zones, resulting in either clusters or structurally controlled alignments of porphyry Cu systems. The rheology and composition of the host rocks may strongly influence the size, grade, and type of mineralization generated in porphyry Cu systems. Individual systems have life spans of 100,000 to several million years, whereas deposit clusters or alignments as well as entire belts may remain active for 10 m.y. or longer.The alteration and mineralization in porphyry Cu systems, occupying many cubic kilometers of rock, are zoned outward from the stocks or dike swarms, which typically comprise several generations of intermediate to felsic porphyry intrusions. Porphyry Cu ± Au ± Mo deposits are centered on the intrusions, whereas carbonate wall rocks commonly host proximal Cu-Au skarns, less common distal Zn-Pb and/or Au skarns, and, beyond the skarn front, carbonate-replacement Cu and/or Zn-Pb-Ag ± Au deposits, and/or sediment-hosted (distal-disseminated) Au deposits. Peripheral mineralization is less conspicuous in noncarbonate wall rocks but may include base metal- or Au-bearing veins and mantos. High-sulfidation epithermal deposits may occur in lithocaps above porphyry Cu deposits, where massive sulfide lodes tend to develop in deeper feeder structures and Au ± Ag-rich, disseminated deposits within the uppermost 500 m or so. Less commonly, intermediate-sulfidation epithermal mineralization, chiefly veins, may develop on the peripheries of the lithocaps. The alteration-mineralization in the porphyry Cu deposits is zoned upward from barren, early sodic-calcic through potentially ore-grade potassic, chlorite-sericite, and sericitic, to advanced argillic, the last of these constituting the lithocaps, which may attain \&gt;1 km in thickness if unaffected by significant erosion. Low sulfidation-state chalcopyrite ± bornite assemblages are characteristic of potassic zones, whereas higher sulfidation-state sulfides are generated progressively upward in concert with temperature decline and the concomitant greater degrees of hydrolytic alteration, culminating in pyrite ± enargite ± covellite in the shallow parts of the litho-caps. The porphyry Cu mineralization occurs in a distinctive sequence of quartz-bearing veinlets as well as in disseminated form in the altered rock between them. Magmatic-hydrothermal breccias may form during porphyry intrusion, with some of them containing high-grade mineralization because of their intrinsic permeability. In contrast, most phreatomagmatic breccias, constituting maar-diatreme systems, are poorly mineralized at both the porphyry Cu and lithocap levels, mainly because many of them formed late in the evolution of systems.Porphyry Cu systems are initiated by injection of oxidized magma saturated with S- and metal-rich, aqueous fluids from cupolas on the tops of the subjacent parental plutons. The sequence of alteration-mineralization events charted above is principally a consequence of progressive rock and fluid cooling, from \&gt;700° to \&lt;250°C, caused by solidification of the underlying parental plutons and downward propagation of the lithostatic-hydrostatic transition. Once the plutonic magmas stagnate, the high-temperature, generally two-phase hyper-saline liquid and vapor responsible for the potassic alteration and contained mineralization at depth and early overlying advanced argillic alteration, respectively, gives way, at \&lt;350°C, to a single-phase, low- to moderate-salinity liquid that causes the sericite-chlorite and sericitic alteration and associated mineralization. This same liquid also causes mineralization of the peripheral parts of systems, including the overlying lithocaps. The progressive thermal decline of the systems combined with synmineral paleosurface degradation results in the characteristic overprinting (telescoping) and partial to total reconstitution of older by younger alteration-mineralization types. Meteoric water is not required for formation of this alteration-mineralization sequence although its late ingress is commonplace.Many features of porphyry Cu systems at all scales need to be taken into account during planning and execution of base and precious metal exploration programs in magmatic arc settings. At the regional and district scales, the occurrence of many deposits in belts, within which clusters and alignments are prominent, is a powerful exploration concept once one or more systems are known. At the deposit scale, particularly in the porphyry Cu environment, early-formed features commonly, but by no means always, give rise to the best ore-bodies. Late-stage alteration overprints may cause partial depletion or complete removal of Cu and Au, but metal concentration may also result. Recognition of single ore deposit types, whether economic or not, in porphyry Cu systems may be directly employed in combination with alteration and metal zoning concepts to search for other related deposit types, although not all those permitted by the model are likely to be present in most systems. Erosion level is a cogent control on the deposit types that may be preserved and, by the same token, on those that may be anticipated at depth. The most distal deposit types at all levels of the systems tend to be visually the most subtle, which may result in their being missed due to overshadowing by more prominent alteration-mineralization.},

	abstract = {The Duolong area is in a strong potential copper mineralization zone associated with felsic intrusions, and several porphyry copper deposits (PCDs) have been identified. The PCDs are characterized by hydrothermal alteration zones. In this study, Sentinel-2A MultiSpectral Instrument (MSI), Advanced Spaceborne Thermal Emission and Reflection Radiometer (ASTER), and Hyperion data are combined to map hydrothermally altered minerals. Three temporal Sentinel-2A MSI images are processed by integrating the Crosta technique and the anomaly-overlaying selection method to map iron oxides and hydroxyl-bearing minerals. These approaches are implemented to omit interference-induced false anomalies. The six shortwave infrared (SWIR) bands of ASTER are used to extract information on Al-OH and Mg-OH group minerals. The distribution of Al-OH minerals in the ASTER image map corresponds to that of hydroxyl-bearing minerals in the MSI image map. A combination of minimum noise fraction (MNF), pixel purity index (PPI), n-dimensional visualizer (n-D Visualizer) and matched filtering (MF) is adopted to process the Hyperion image to obtain accurate hydrothermal alteration mapping results. The overall accuracy for mineral mapping is 92.75\% and the kappa coefficient is 0.89. The results of the Hyperion image are spatially consistent with those of the Sentinel-2A MSI and ASTER images. The image processing results were validated by field investigations and spectral reflectance measurements. Hydrothermally altered rocks correspond well with the five PCDs in the Duolong area. Three mineralization prospects associated with felsic intrusions are discovered in accordance with the results. The methodologies and data are effective in detecting porphyry copper mineralization in other arid areas.},
